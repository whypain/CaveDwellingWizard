IMPORTANT!
Check out Credits.txt so you know how and who you need to credit since some pieces and songs have multiple collaborators.

Additional info:
This pack was created with visual novels in mind but you don't have to limit its use to visual novels if you want to use these pieces and sound effects in other kinds of games or media.

Included in this pack are: 
14 Pieces;
3 Songs (each with a TV length and a full length version);
10 UI SFX;
12 Transition jingles;

Some pieces have an intro and a main part. You have to play the intro part and queue the main part to play right after it so that the intro only plays once and the main part gets looped. If you can't do that then you can just play the main part but you might have to fade it in to make sure that it doesn't start too suddenly.
Some tracks in the folder "Pieces" have full versions. These full versions aren't loopable but can be used for outros/intros, game teasers or other situations where pieces don't necessarily have to loop.

You can of course contact me any time if you have any questions per E-Mail (links are below).

Make sure to check out the channels/social media of the awesome collaborators who helped me make this pack as awesome and massive as it is!
